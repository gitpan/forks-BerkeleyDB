0.03	5 October 2006
	Corrected method by which CORE::GLOBAL::fork was overridden--now it really is
	working correctly (at compile-time).
	
	Signifigantly cleaned up and further optimized pre/post thread spawn logic.
	
	Corrected slow memory leak in threads whenever they would spawn new threads,
	caused by BerkeleyDB XS-level cleanup that was being inadvertantly skipped.

0.02	6 August 2006
	Implemented transparent bless across threads (note: feature will be silently
	disabled unless forks.pm >= 0.19 is installed).
	
	Updated test suite to match complete forks 0.19 set of tests (including blessed
	object tests).
	
	Implemented separate config module to allow access to global constants between
	packages.
	
	Moved base BDB base environment to BerkeleyDB.pm (was originally in shared.pm).
	
	Reworked some internals to better handle overriding of function calls, when
	necessary by other support modules.
	
	Implemented Scalar::Util::reftype instead of ref() in internal function
	_filter_store_value to correctly support blessed references.
	
	Enabled database syncing in shared.pm END block to improve data integrity.
	
	Corrected minor POD bug in forks::BerkeleyDB::shared::array.
	
	Corrected a few file text formats to prevent inconsistencies between package
	signature and package contents.

0.01	25 April 2006
	First public version.
