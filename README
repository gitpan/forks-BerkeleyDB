README for forks::BerkeleyDB

This module is a drop-in replacement for threads.pm.  It has the
same syntax as the threads.pm module (it even takes over its namespace) but
has some significant differences:

- you do _not_ need a special (threaded) version of Perl
- it is _much_ more economic with memory usage on OS's that support COW.
  Additionally, it uses local temp filesystem space for most shared variable
  data, so memory savings are at a premium when dealing with very large
  shared variables
- it is more efficient in the startup of threads
- it is slightly less efficient in the stopping of threads
- it is less efficient in inter-thread communication
